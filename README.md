# Adventure-Works Data Engineer Project

## Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project using the **Adventure Works** dataset, provided by **Kaggle**, designed for Azure Data Engineer tasks. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights using various Azure tools and services, along with Data Engineering techniques.

The project covers key aspects of data engineering, such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as data storage, querying, and reporting. It is designed to align with Azure Data Engineering skills and best practices.

## Project Components

This project is split into several stages to illustrate the full workflow from raw data ingestion to insightful data visualization:

1. **Data Extraction**:  
   - Data is sourced from the **Adventure Works** Kaggle dataset.
   - The dataset includes customer, sales, product, and employee information, among others.

2. **Data Transformation (ETL)**:  
   - Cleanse, transform, and aggregate the data using Python, SQL, and Azure Data Engineering tools.
   - This stage includes data wrangling, filling missing values, and data type conversions.

3. **Data Storage**:  
   - Data is stored in Azure services like **Azure Blob Storage**, **Azure SQL Database**, and **Azure Data Lake**.

4. **Data Integration and Querying**:  
   - Data is integrated and queried using **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **SQL Server**.
   - The querying layer involves the creation of various views, aggregations, and transformation logic.

5. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Generate meaningful reports and dashboards using **Power BI** and **Azure Data Studio** to showcase the actionable insights derived from the data.

6. **Automation & Orchestration**:  
   - Automate the data pipeline using **Azure Data Factory** or **Azure Logic Apps**.
   - Schedule the ETL processes to run automatically at defined intervals.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Synapse Analytics** – Data warehousing, querying, and integration.
- **Azure Data Factory** – ETL pipeline automation and orchestration.
- **Azure SQL Database** – Data storage and querying.
- **Azure Blob Storage** – Cloud data storage.
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and reporting.
- **Python** – Data transformation and scripting.
- **SQL** – Data querying and manipulation.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Adventure Works** dataset, available on **Kaggle**. You can download the dataset directly from [Kaggle - Adventure Works Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/). It includes various data tables related to sales, products, customers, and employees.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription to use Azure services such as Azure SQL, Blob Storage, and Data Factory.
- **Kaggle Account**: You need a Kaggle account to download the Adventure Works dataset.
- **Python 3.x**: Python and libraries such as pandas, pyodbc, and matplotlib for transformation and data analysis.
- **Power BI**: To visualize the data through interactive dashboards.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Download the Dataset**:  
   Download the Adventure Works dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Azure Blob Storage or your local machine.

2. **Set up Azure Resources**:  
   - Set up Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, or any other Azure resources needed for the project.
   - Define your ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:  
   - Use Jupyter notebooks to perform the data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
   - Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory can be used for automation.

4. **Run Power BI**:  
   - Open the Power BI reports in the `reports/` directory to visualize the results and insights from the data.

5. **Deploy to Azure**:  
   - Use Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure SQL Database to run the queries and host the final reporting data.
